# DunGen

Generate random rouge-like dungeons in a handy JSON format.
DunGen is a random dungeon generator based on 'Appendix A: Random Dungeon'
presented in the DnD 5e Dungeon Master's Guide. Presented in a handy JSON
format to allow use in multiple applications.

## General Information

There are many random dungeon generators out there. However, they are often
very specific in their purpose; generating a tilemap in a pre determined style
or being generated inside a bigger game. The goal of DunGen is to be a simple
set of python modules designed to output a random dungeon in JSON format from a
set of starting parameters. What the user does with the dungeon after that is up
to them!
